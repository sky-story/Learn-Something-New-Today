Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/sky-story/Learn-Something-New-Today.git
cd tutorial-website
Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username if not yet set.

2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)
For Mac/Linux:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
For Windows:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Required Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed (preferably 3.8+). Then run:

pip install -r requirements.txt
If using a simple front-end only (HTML/CSS/JS), you may not have any requirements.txt, and can skip this step.

4. Run the App Locally
If it’s a front-end app only, just open index.html in your browser:

open index.html         # macOS
start index.html        # Windows
Or use a live server extension in VSCode for hot-reloading and easier development.

If you're using a Python-based server (e.g. Flask), run:
python app.py
